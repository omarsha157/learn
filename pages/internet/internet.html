        <h3>Internet</h3>
        <p>
            A global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
        </p>

        <h3>Internet protocol</h3>
        <p>
            The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called <strong>packets</strong>. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps <strong><a href="#router" class="anchor-color-unset">routers</a></strong> to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an <strong><a href="#ipAddress" class="anchor-color-unset">IP address</a></strong>, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which <strong>transport protocol</strong> is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="router">Routers</h3>
        <p>
            A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.
        </p>
        <p>
            A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.
        </p>

        <h3 id="ipAddress">IP address</h3>
        <p>
            IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying number that is associated with a specific computer or computer network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and receive information.
